      "2020-04-25 22:18:38 boakyewaaglover @StephenSeanFord Absolutely like John Wick. It’s the close contact kills &amp; the multiple shots / stabs to one guy &amp; the way he holds the bad guys’ heads as he’s shooting &amp; stabbing. That’s straight from John Wick. One shot or stab doesn’t cut it anymore. Geez lol #ExtractionNetflix\n",

      "2020-04-25 21:18:55 ieshadaboya I’d like for the fighting scenes to be much longer than what was given here. Longer and wider shots where I can see the movement. That’s what makes good action to me. The chereo could have been a tiny bit better, as well #ExtractionNetflix\n",
      "2020-04-25 21:18:55 ieshadaboya I think the best of Sam’s work is Atomic Blonde and if he’s able to capture that seamless style to the next film (which this seems like it’ll get a sequel) he’ll be good to go #ExtractionNetflix\n",
      "2020-04-25 21:18:55 ieshadaboya Also this thing with these kids and the violence towards and at them felt kinda cheesy, IMO. I did like the kid actor though. He’s great #ExtractionNetflix\n",
      "2020-04-25 21:18:55 ieshadaboya I love me some Chris but his charisma doesn’t really show in this compared to Keanu in the JW franchise.

      "2020-04-25 21:18:54 ieshadaboya It’s a wonderful debut for Sam and I would want to see what else he does but it’s a lot of basic violence for no reason.

There was no demonising or stereotyping. Sometimes I felt it was so Bollywood &amp; yet sophisticated Hollywood action movie. Rating: 3.5/5 https://t.co/zYNyZQD8td\n",

The fights were the highlights, no surprise, dialogue got spotty in parts, worth the watch\n",
